          it's difficult for high schools to keep their curricula and clubs up

          we maintain and update a library of workshops designed for high
          schoolers to prepare for and learn about the newest careers in STEM.
          these include robotics, quantum computing, artifical intelligence, and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          we also recruit and train top-performing university students to
          instruct the workshops covering their field of expertise. this keeps
          our pool of instructors fresh, up-to-date, and local to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          below are the workshops we offer and the cities we service. whether
          you're a student looking to instruct or a school looking to book, if
          you can't find your city just get in touch with us. we're always
          looking to expand our network.
